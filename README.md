### Overview

I am interested in creating a web app that will allow users to post or share places
they've visited , and make like a little review about places to visit , restaurants , hotels , etc. and also
implement rating stars for each field(restaurants , hotels , places to visit)

In general , to talk about places the user has visited ,
that would be able to be seen by the other users.
